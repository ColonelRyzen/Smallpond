PDRC-34#1 Error
MMCM_adv_ClkFrequency_div_no_dclk  
The computed value 400.000 MHz (CLKIN1_PERIOD, net pll_clk3) for the VCO operating frequency of the MMCME2_ADV site MMCME2_ADV_X1Y0 (cell design_1_i/mig_7series_0/u_design_1_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/gen_mmcm.mmcm_i) falls outside the operating range of the MMCM VCO frequency for this device (600.000 - 1200.000 MHz). The computed value is (CLKFBOUT_MULT_F * 1000 / (CLKINx_PERIOD * DIVCLK_DIVIDE)). Please run update_timing to update the MMCM settings. If that does not work, adjust either the input period CLKINx_PERIOD (20.000000), multiplication factor CLKFBOUT_MULT_F (8.000000) or the division factor DIVCLK_DIVIDE (1), in order to achieve a VCO frequency within the rated operating range for this device.
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-46#1 Critical Warning
v7v8_mmcm_fvco_rule1  
The current computed target frequency, FVCO, is out of range for cell design_1_i/mig_7series_0/u_design_1_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/gen_mmcm.mmcm_i. The computed FVCO is 400.000 MHz. The valid FVCO range for speed grade -1 is 600MHz to 1200MHz. The cell attribute values used to compute FVCO are CLKFBOUT_MULT_F = 8.000, CLKIN1_PERIOD = 20.00000, and DIVCLK_DIVIDE = 1 (FVCO = 1000 * CLKFBOUT_MULT_F/(CLKIN1_PERIOD * DIVCLK_DIVIDE)).
This violation may be corrected by:
  1. The timer uses timing constraints for clock period or clock frequency that affect CLKIN1 to set cell attribute CLKIN1_PERIOD, over-riding any previous value. This may already be in place and, if so this violation will be resolved once Timing is run.  Otherwise, consider modifying timing constraints to adjust the CLKIN1_PERIOD and bring FVCO into the allowed range.
  2. In the absence of timing constraints that affect CLKIN1, consider modifying the cell CLKIN1_PERIOD to bring FVCO into the allowed range.
  3. If CLKIN1_PERIOD is satisfactory, modify the CLKFBOUT_MULT_F or DIVCLK_DIVIDE cell attributes to bring FVCO into the allowed range.
  4. The MMCM configuration may be dynamically modified by use of DRP which is recognized by an ACTIVE signal on DCLK pin.

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
103 out of 155 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: sp_data_in_0[31:0], sp_data_out_0[31:0], sp_addr_0[31:0], sp_op_len_0[1:0], sp_write_0, sp_sign_extend_0, sp_read_0, sp_over_0, sp_error_0.
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
103 out of 155 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: sp_data_in_0[31:0], sp_data_out_0[31:0], sp_addr_0[31:0], sp_op_len_0[1:0], sp_write_0, sp_sign_extend_0, sp_read_0, sp_over_0, sp_error_0.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal design_1_i/mig_7series_0/u_design_1_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the design_1_i/mig_7series_0/u_design_1_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of design_1_i/mig_7series_0/u_design_1_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
